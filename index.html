  <h1>Important Concepts</h1>
  <b>WWW - World Wide Web</b>
  <p>it is an information system on the Internet that <em>allows documents to be connected</em> to other documents by hypertext links, enabling the user to search for information by moving from one document to another.</p>
  <b>HTML - Hypertext Markup Language</b>
  <p>a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve <em>font</em>, <em>color</em>, <em>graphic</em>, and <em>hyperlink</em> effects on World Wide Web pages.</p>
  <b>Tags</b>
  <p>are the <em>hidden keywords</em> within a web page that define how the browser must format and display the content. Most tags must have two parts, an opening and a closing part. You can determine the closing tag because it has a slash.</p>
  <b>Why computers are stupid?</b>
  <p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
  literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a
  small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems
    in a program.</p>
